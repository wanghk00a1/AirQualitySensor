1141177687135928321,1560912937000,LONDON,-1,Guyana have been alright in the first half, especially the first 30 mins, managing to get 2 corners and a shot on the US goal. After conceding the Arriola goal, we've just been soaking up the pressure and the US have had way more chances and we've made a few errors.#GoldCup2019
