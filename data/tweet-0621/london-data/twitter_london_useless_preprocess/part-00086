1138708603047677952,1560324261000,LONDON,-1,been on holiday for the past week, reading @michaelpollan’s excellent new How to Change Your Mind. a hunch i’ve been considering since: civilian nuclear power and psychedelic drugs have an oddly similar trajectory (on some fronts) https://t.co/8gJW8GL06n
1138708607099387912,1560324262000,LONDON,0,pollan notes that lsd was discovered the same time as the bomb. but it’s the enthusiasm for nuclear power that it reminds me of more: both fields started out entangled with military industrial complex, but their proponents sought to liberate the technology from those constraints
1138708609003659264,1560324263000,LONDON,-1,significant crossover too, in the whole earth/california moment through to silicon valley today. forever on the cusp of a renaissance. but both also came up hard against the limits big claims for the technologies (‘energy too cheap to meter!’ ‘chemical enlightenment for all!’)
1138708611549601792,1560324263000,LONDON,-1,and proponents of both nuclear and psychedelics today seem to focus on the public backlash — and narrowly, on fear/irrationality in publics — rather than the limits of the technology thus far *as it interacts with society* (be it cost, regulation, safety, trust etc)
1138708613428592640,1560324264000,LONDON,-1,there are limits to my comparison too, of course. pollan’s book is fascinating and beautifully written. i’m also pro legalisation. but feel like a take on psychedelics less drug- focused, more critical about its integration with say health systems and inequality, would help
1138708616477851648,1560324265000,LONDON,-1,much as nuclear might have a role to play, but its history and prospects are more complex than a miracle technology unfairly maligned — and needs to be considered in light of whole energy system with cheaper renewables etc etc — similar view of psychedelics in health might help
1138708618214289408,1560324265000,LONDON,-1,and questions raised by articles like this, which don’t really feature — about ownership, democracy and access to mental health services including potentially psychedelic therapies, might become more critical https://t.co/Jn9J4HEgAD
