1134745359656390656,1559379350000,LONDON,-1,@Heresy_Corner That's surely a false parallel. By paying tax for doctor's salaries via the NHS we are (almost all) benefiting from their services. Of course, doctors need training, but then so do engineers, lawyers, IT experts and so on and they, in turn gain personal financial benefit.
