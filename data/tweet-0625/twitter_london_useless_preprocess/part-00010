And we are told that time is running out because the EU will not extend again beyond October. Is is all actually that black-and-white?

1143241635251261440,1561405020000,NULL,-1,it was the UK govt who took various things ‚Äòoff the table‚Äô (ie. free movement), and it was those red lines which closed off, for example, a Norway-style arrangement. It wasn‚Äôt that the EU would never have countenanced giving us a Norway-style Deal right from the start, was it?
1143241637730148352,1561405021000,NULL,-1,so a new UK govt could put (for example) free movement back on the table. We could go back to the EU and say ‚ÄúHey, y‚Äôknow how we told you that [x] and [y] were dealbreakers for us? Well we‚Äôve had a think, and they‚Äôre not dealbreakers any more‚Ä¶‚Äù
1143241640263503873,1561405022000,NULL,-1,not saying that such a move would be politically expedient, by the way‚Ä¶ Just that we could do it. But there‚Äôs no time! Is there?

1143241642931097601,1561405022000,NULL,-1,the way I read it, we need the EU‚Äôs agreement to extend Article 50. But not to revoke it. We could unilaterally revoke Article 50 and resend it the next day, thus starting the clock again for two years. Again, this may not be a smart move ‚Äî but it is possible, isn‚Äôt it?
