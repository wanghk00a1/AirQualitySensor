1139645172986384384,1560547557000,LONDON,-1,Yeah, so last week @ifvp asked about travel tips and mine was travel hand luggage only. So.... Was asked at gate by @British_Airways staff to let them put luggage in hold and..... Luggage is still in Germany. So flight delayed an hour, problems offloading from plane and now this!
