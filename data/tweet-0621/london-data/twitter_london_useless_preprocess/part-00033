There is no doubting the power of ‘sports stars as role models’ and can clearly influence behaviour in many areas of life eg promoting good health / education.

1135468580068384770,1559551780000,LONDON,-1,Sport can help people engage with others that normally wouldn’t do. I still maintain the issues around racism / faith / gender are not just a football specific issue but a society issue. Any type of hatred towards another decent human being should not be acceptable, ever.
