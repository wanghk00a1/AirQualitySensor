The addition of the black and brown strip onto the traditional flag isn't meant to replace the Pride flag but to pay respect to a marginalised group within our community. https://t.co/al33Bfhypm
1135518666131496961,1559563721000,LONDON,-1,If you're outraged or offended by the More Colour More Pride flag then you're missing the point and should be asking yourself "Why did this flag need to be created and what can we do to help those who are still facing discrimination/racism from within our community". 🏳️‍🌈

1135518672758423552,1559563723000,LONDON,-1,Lastly, yes Leather Pride is included as it's a huge sub group within our community. The flags in the image are just a small few, we have many many more. We are after all a diverse community.
