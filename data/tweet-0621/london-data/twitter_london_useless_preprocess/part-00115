1139918887888310272,1560612816000,LONDON,-1,Interesting day at @Conservatives National Convention leadership hustings. On Brexit the candidates fell into three groups: Leave on the 3 October deal or no deal (Johnson, Raab, Javid, Hunt), extend if necessary to get a deal over the line (Gove), pass the PM's deal (Stewart)
1139918891155677184,1560612816000,NULL,-1,@mitsyarty @IanTayl23605350 @Ismail1Shah Core ones, very rarely.  Please excuse my rudeness, but what you write comes from your belief, not one that can be substantiated by declarative psychological research. Brexit to one side, my point remains, BJ is a nasty man.
1139918892623679490,1560612817000,LONDON,-1,Johnson and Hunt agreed that the PM's deal is dead. And that a few deal based around Malthouse or Brady was needed, with no deal if the EU wouldn't play ball. Raab favoured an exchange of letters over the backstop. Javid a technological solution for the Irish border.
1139918895274500096,1560612817000,LONDON,-1,In terms of performance, Johnson owned the room, getting cheers and applause simply by dashing to the stage. He didn't need to do much more to own most of the room. He was also more focussed and disciplined than usual.
1139918897963032577,1560612818000,LONDON,-1,Javid had a lot more passion and force than usual and was insistent that the members had a proper vote. Confirmatory votes being the sort of thing that happened in Soviet satellite states, not the @Conservatives.
1139918898030161921,1560612818000,LONDON,-1,“Life’s different with these big suppositories, Malcolm,” father-in-law, 93 says from the back seat of the car.“Just stop here,” I tell Mrs Wilson, “I’ll get out and walk.”He’s found my achilles heel.
1139918900458659846,1560612819000,LONDON,-1,Raab played up his steely negotiating skills, but shone best when he talked about party reform to give the members more say with a directly elected party chairman. But he still didn't seem like a large enough personality to get traction quickly.
1139918902786514944,1560612819000,LONDON,-1,Hunt had some good jokes and came over well, but probably oversold himself as the leader the EU would listen to (it's hard to imagine Frau Merkel really telling him to sort the Irish border out and then things would be game on.
1139918905034629120,1560612820000,LONDON,1,Gove was a powerful orator, but brought with him a lot of baggage. He was fun to listen to as an intellectual exercise, but hard to imagine as a visionary leader for our times.
1139918907307958272,1560612820000,LONDON,-1,And Stewart? He was totally tonto. Snide and dismissive of the other candidates and very much buying into his own social media myth. Talked a lot about change but not much about how it would be delivered, or what the goal would be.

1139923871447097345,1560614004000,LONDON,-1,Because for me at least Star Wars helped open me allot of expression and exploration of my feelings and identity. Something that has been a big journey for me but I don’t think I would have learnt as much or been open if it where not for the people around the Star Wars community
1139923874383093760,1560614005000,LONDON,-1,And the questions that the shows and saga make you think of. Characters like Sabine, Ezra, Luke, Ahsoka embody these personal journies of learning and self discovery. I have already come far in that journey though of late I have been more quite about that, truth is
1139923876660621313,1560614005000,LONDON,-1,It’s all complicated but I’m better off for it. I guess I’m some sort of asexual mixed with some less sort of binary gender elements. I guess I’m kinda a outwardly individual person who doesn’t like to associate with anything and just wants to be whatever they want 😂
1139923878954881026,1560614006000,LONDON,-1,Anyhow it’s characters in Star Wars who had that individual streak. Sabine Obviously 😭💜 that have inspired and taught me to go out be who I am be proud and express that, which I have.So that is what Star Wars has done for me, but again these are small cases.
1139923881660243969,1560614006000,LONDON,-1,Actual characters representing people of LGBTQIA are limited and practicallynon existent in the TV and Film in an official mentioned capacity. Like yea I’m a big Saberza Shipper But Sabine can totally be a Lesbian. I’d like to see characters like that appear naturally!
1139923883698675714,1560614007000,LONDON,-1,Like don’t force it but also please Star Wars is so diverse with Aliens and Creatures. Why not people.
