1140178698345287681,1560674759000,LONDON,-1,So it’s essential you try to land the sale in at least 24hrs. Here are steps to take to ensure you close the #dealSTEP 1: Start with a #friendly welcome message. Hello isn’t good enough, you can use #messages like “Hello Sir, thanks for messaging us, how may we help you today?”
1140178700723507200,1560674760000,LONDON,-1,STEP 2: Provide enough and #adequate information about the service or product. Not to much to overwhelm them but just enough to help them make a #decision.
1140178702283825153,1560674760000,LONDON,0,STEP 3: #Timing is very important, don’t delay with replies and sending the necessary information they asked for. Some people don’t have the patience to wait, they’ll just abandon the chat.
1140178703588220928,1560674761000,LONDON,0,STEP 4: #Build trust. You can provide reviews and any other information you think will help put their minds at ease, especially when you sense they don’t trust the business. This is due to the high rate of #scams.
