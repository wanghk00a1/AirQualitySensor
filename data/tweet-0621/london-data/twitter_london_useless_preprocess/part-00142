1140879305104338944,1560841797000,LONDON,-1,My parents told me to toughen up. I was too soft. School called me a problem child because I refused to take part in PE, or turn up. They failed me.After years of torment because of how I looked, because of who I was, my family dropped me. I became homeless & I spiralled.
1140879307201531905,1560841798000,LONDON,0,When everyone you love, & respect beats you down & tells you how abnormal you are, you do everything you can to be normal. I tried to straighten up! Find work, form relationships, be OK. I hated myself. I had no way of explaining my experiences or identity. Nobody saw me.

1140879309281910784,1560841798000,LONDON,-1,In my early twenties I broke. I’d tried to take my own life. I self-harmed. I didn’t want to live in a world that couldn’t understand me. I didn’t want to be around.I needed to be me. That meant facing it all, and taking on everyone who despised me for being different.
1140879312675119104,1560841799000,LONDON,0,I came out as trans. I studied law at uni. I trained as a barrister. I began working with marginalised groups.I was finally able to see a future in a world where I could be happy. Finally being able to name my identity and explain my experience changed my life.
1140879314688368640,1560841799000,LONDON,-1,Being trans meant that I lost most of my family for good. People I called friends walked away. I lost my job. My uni made fun of my identity.As a barrister I had no chance at success. Judges & other advocates were transphobic. The profession made my journey impossible.
1140879316957327360,1560841800000,LONDON,-1,I faced a two year wait to see a gender healthcare specialist. I saw the horrible ways the NHS treated its trans patients. I was thrown around the services and my weight, my past, my mental health, were all barriers to treatment.Things needed to change. So I wanted to campaign
1140879319218212864,1560841800000,LONDON,-1,Over time there has been progress. Society was becoming kinder, more understanding. Things could potentially improve for all the kids like me who were otherwise hated.It was about supporting trans people to be themselves and to get on in life.

1140879321508339713,1560841801000,LONDON,0,Schools began to think about how to support children. The government began asking how to make life less painful for trans people. Organisations wanted to know how to prevent discrimination for their staff & customers.People were trying to help.

1140879323987107840,1560841802000,LONDON,-1,But people turned against the progress. Now, it’s more toxic and more hate filled than ever. Misinformation and lies have led us to a place where trans people are openly mocked, harassed and abused. There is no check on the transphobia we see all around us.
1140879325991964672,1560841802000,LONDON,-1,We are witnessing this march backwards. I’m terrified other people will face a life that is impossible, in a society that undermines their identities at every turn. We’re losing our humanity. We’re separating people into freaks and poofs.
1140879328256909313,1560841803000,LONDON,-1,And people are being hurt. Lives are being ruined. The world hates people like me.
1140879330131742720,1560841803000,LONDON,-1,Does it have to be this way? Do we have to scream science at trans people in some attempt to argue they’re not valid? Must we accuse people of being child abusers for wanting to support trans children to be themselves?

Why should collection of passport ends at 2pm even though they know they have people in their hundreds thronging in to collect passport everyday from different parts of UK?
1140891315221217281,1560844660000,LONDON,-1,Nigerian passport is over £100 (45k) for renewal of just 32 pages. You will have to book appointment, pay the charges, go to the embassy, do biometric enrolment, go back to your house, then come back again weeks later for collection. Such a tedious procedures.
1140891316760567809,1560844661000,LONDON,-1,Meanwhile British passport is £75 (30k) you do everything from your house and the passport sent to you through the post. Why can't Nigeria High Commission adopt such system? Everything is analogue home & away.
