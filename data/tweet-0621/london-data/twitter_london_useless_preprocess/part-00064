1138012286478692352,1560158246000,LONDON,-1,While a "free at the point of use" NHS is essential to retain, this phrase masks the real risk to the NHS, which is the sort of business model that lies behind it. At present much (not all) of the NHS is still run as a public service; it need deliver neither profit nor dividend.
1138012287606960128,1560158247000,LONDON,0,It is therefore in the public interest for the NHS to negotiate, for example, the best possible prices for its consumables, drugs and equipment - and any professional medical services it purchases. It can (still, just) do this by using its scale as a negotiating tool.
1138012288663863297,1560158247000,LONDON,-1,If, on the other hand, the NHS moves to a private sector business model, there is no such obligation to the public interest. Instead the NHS becomes a predatory marketplace, occupied by companies prioritising the greatest commercial advantage over the well-being of patients.
1138012289712439296,1560158247000,LONDON,-1,Prices will go up as profits and dividends are delivered. Deals will be done over the cost of medicines and consultants' fees which will see prices rise tenfold or more to US levels. All of this has to be paid for, and it can either be through some form of medical insurance, or
1138012290802999298,1560158248000,LONDON,-1,the taxpayer can foot the bill, so that Government can say "Look, we have kept the NHS free at the point of use". But instead of the bulk of our tax contribution going direct to front-line NHS services, as now, it will be going direct to the companies running the NHS for profit.
1138012292006711297,1560158248000,LONDON,0,Let's fight for a "free at the point of use" NHS. It's vital. But that on its own is not enough. Let's also fight to keep the NHS a truly public service all the way through, not simply a vastly more expensive tax-payer-funded private sector feeding trough, making companies rich.
