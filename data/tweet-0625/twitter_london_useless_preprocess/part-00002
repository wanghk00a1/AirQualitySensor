1142184755670257665,1561153041000,LONDON,-1,2/ The media have done little to change this narrative painting the #Winklevii as “buttoned-down men of Harvard” who sued their way to riches. In the intro to his new book “#Bitcoin Billionnaires” @benmezrich explains how this enshrined image of the twins is in need of revising.
1142184757079564291,1561153041000,LONDON,-1,3/ With the #Winklevii’s second act as #Bitcoin pioneer’s, @benmezrich asserts: “It is my opinion that Cameron & Tyler #Winklevoss didn’t just happen to be standing in the exact right place, at the exact right time, twice, by chance.”
1142184758593630212,1561153041000,LONDON,1,4/ “Second acts, in literature, as in life, are rare.” @benmezrich continues. “There is every chance that that the #Winlevoss twin’s second act will eventually over-shadow their first.”
1142184760053305344,1561153042000,LONDON,-1,5/ “#Bitcoin and the technology behind it has the capacity to upend the Internet. It isn’t a fad, or a bubble or a scheme - it’s a fundamental paradigm shift, and it will eventually change everything.”
1142184761508712456,1561153042000,LONDON,-1,6. ‘Bitcoin Billionaires’ is a great read & will likely leave u with a very different opinion of the #Winklevoss twins. The book also covers the rise & fall of #BitInstant and how @rogerver, @ErikVoorhees & @CharlieShrem helped shape the Bitcoin story. https://t.co/JDLaiiIz04
