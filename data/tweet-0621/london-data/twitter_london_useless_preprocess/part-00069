1138142212397703168,1560189223000,LONDON,-1,Sometimes such silly thoughts come to my mind, honestly. Today I couldn't go to work because of my toenail. I've got an ingrown nail for months an it's so sore now. It was bleeding so much. I tried to go to the bus stop twice but came back home due to the uncomfortable feeling.
1138142213890813952,1560189224000,LONDON,-1,So I call my bosses and they were very understanding. Sent them pictures and it's all good, I'm taking the day off to recover and will be seeing a chiropodist this week but still. I'm feeling so bad to myself.
1138142215237263366,1560189224000,LONDON,-1,I'm feeling useless and sad like I did something bad and overwhelmed people on my work by missing it, or that I'll not receive enough money just because of one day less of payment then I won't be able to enjoy more my holidays, etc etc. It's so sad.
1138142216730423297,1560189224000,LONDON,-1,It's sad because I know I'm being silly or stupid but I can't handle my feelings/mind to work against me in these moments. Then I start to compare myself to others with simple bullshits.
1138142218135506944,1560189225000,LONDON,-1,For example saying to myself that I'm a lazy bastard because everyone is working today apart from me, and they're carrying on with their lives full of problems but I can't go to work because of a simple ingrown nail pain.
1138142219494481922,1560189225000,LONDON,-1,I know it's quite silly and everyone has their on limits but then I feel myself weak and there's nothing else I can do. I wanted to comeback on time and go to work even with pain just to avoid having these thoughts/feelings on my mind.
