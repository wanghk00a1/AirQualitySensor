1143241626615263232,1561405018000,NULL,-1,I am, as usual, confused by Brexit. Specifically, Brexit timetabling. We are told that the Deal is the Deal, and the EU will not renegotiate. And we are told that time is running out because the EU will not extend again beyond October. Is is all actually that black-and-white?
1143241620034412544,1561405017000,LONDON,0,Louderrrr
1143241632529166336,1561405020000,NULL,-1,I don’t know much about any of this, so please correct any inaccuracies, but the way I’ve understood it is this… The Deal is such because of ‘red lines’ (on both sides of the negotiating table).
1143241635251261440,1561405020000,NULL,-1,it was the UK govt who took various things ‘off the table’ (ie. free movement), and it was those red lines which closed off, for example, a Norway-style arrangement. It wasn’t that the EU would never have countenanced giving us a Norway-style Deal right from the start, was it?
1143241637730148352,1561405021000,NULL,-1,so a new UK govt could put (for example) free movement back on the table. We could go back to the EU and say “Hey, y’know how we told you that [x] and [y] were dealbreakers for us? Well we’ve had a think, and they’re not dealbreakers any more…”
1143241640263503873,1561405022000,NULL,-1,not saying that such a move would be politically expedient, by the way… Just that we could do it. But there’s no time! Is there?

1143241642931097601,1561405022000,NULL,-1,the way I read it, we need the EU’s agreement to extend Article 50. But not to revoke it. We could unilaterally revoke Article 50 and resend it the next day, thus starting the clock again for two years. Again, this may not be a smart move — but it is possible, isn’t it?
1143241645359546369,1561405023000,NULL,-1,or is this all just a load of rubbish? I’m just musing out loud here — and there are far cleverer people than I on here who understand it all much, much better… I just can’t square what I’ve read about the process with the doom-mongering about how our fate is totally sealed.

And that’s but a small fraction of global mortality in the 1914-18 and 1939-45 conflicts. #LestWeForget The financial cost was less important, but still enormous.
