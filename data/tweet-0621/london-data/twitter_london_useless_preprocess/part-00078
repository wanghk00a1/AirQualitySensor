1138441205497442304,1560260509000,LONDON,0,What a difference a day makes..... https://t.co/BDjBeaH4R3
1138441209813307396,1560260510000,LONDON,0,مشروع ليبرا هو اهم المشاريع التي تشتغل عليها الفيسبوك حاليا خلف الأبواب و التفاصيل لي الان هو ان مشروع يتضمن تكنولوجيا الكريبتو كرينسي أو العملة الرقمية المشفرة و المشروع يطمح لي تطوير نظام مالي أو نظام دفع جديد علي منصة فيسبوك
1138441211717574661,1560260510000,LONDON,0,لو فيسبوك بلد لكانت أكبر بلد من ناحية النسمة السكنية يعني حوالي أكثر من2.2 مليار  شخص أو تقريبا ثلث العالم و هذا فقط 14عام من عمرها و هذا رقم خيالي و الأكبر بنسبة لي اي منصة تواصل اجتماعي أو أي شركة معروفة
1138441213227520000,1560260511000,LONDON,0,وهذا يعني لو قرر الفيسبوك انه يدخل سوق معين او مجال معين حيكون ثأثيره كبير جدا و يكبر بسرعة كبيرة و سوق النظام المالي او تحديدا التحويلات المالية سوق عالمي كبير فمثلا البنك الدولي قال ان في ٢٠١٨ تحويل 529$ مليار دولار من الناس التي دخلها محدود و متوسط فقط
1138441214649409536,1560260511000,LONDON,0,يعني أفضل مثال لي فهم الموضوع في وضعنا هيا التحويلات عن طريق ويسترن يونين لي داخل و خارج البلاد و هذا أفضل طريقة لي الناس لي تحويل او استقبال مبلغ مالي خارج البلاد في نفس اللحظة وهذا كان 62$ مليار في نفس العام في شمال أفريقيا و الشرق الأوسط
1138441216079618048,1560260511000,LONDON,0,معظمنا يعرف البتكوين و كيف سعرها يركب و ينزل و مهبل الناس و قاسم الناس بين متخوف من التكنولوجيا و محب ليها شركة زي فيسبوك يهمها خصائص و مميزات التكنولوجيا و كيف تستفيد بيه و تستغلها لي مصلحتها و تحقيق أرباح
1138441217295966212,1560260512000,LONDON,0,فيسبوك جابت المدير التنفيذي السابق لي PayPal و طلبت منه ان يستغل التكنولوجيا في إنشاء نظام مالي تطلقه لي مستخدميها و تسهل عليهم تحويل قيمة مالية عن طريق المسنجر و الواتساب ( ملك فيسبوك ) زي وسهولة و استخدام الباي بال

1138441219049238528,1560260512000,LONDON,0,الفيسبوك يخطط ان عن طريقة العملة متعه ان تقدر تشري بيها اونلاين او تدفع بيها خدمات داخل صفحات الفيسبوك او خارجها مش بس تبعتها و تستقبلها بين الأشخاص و يفكرو ان يربطو سعر العملة بي سعر الدولار الواحد و هذا يقال عليه stable coin ١ عملة فيسبوك = ١ دولار
1138441220999565317,1560260512000,LONDON,0,التقارير تقول أن فيسبوك تقابلات مع العديد من لشركات و الأشخاص المهمة في نفس السوق و هم ويسترن يونين ( يعتقد انهم شركاء في العملة )محافظ المصرف المركزي الإنجليزي الخزينة الاميركية هذا يعطي احساس ان فيسبوك تفكر انها اضم كل الأشخاص و المؤسسات التي ليها وزن كبير لي إنجاح مشروع
1138441222773792768,1560260513000,LONDON,-1,و يقال ان اسم العملة المتوقع هو GlobelCoin و اول سوق او بلاد متوقعة انها تكون الهند و بعدها تنتشر حول العالم

1138441224405299200,1560260513000,LONDON,0,لو نجح المشروع هذا معنها ان اكثر من ٢ مليار مستخدم يستعمل نفس العملة حول العالم و هذا شيء كبير جدا بما ان العملة حتكون ديجيتال و يمكن التعامل بيها إلكترونيا و مش محتاج لي طباعة ورقية او نقلها ومن مصلحة الفيسبوك انها تتوزع لي اكبر عدد ممكن مش تكون تحت تحكم مجموعة معينة 👀
1138441225806196736,1560260514000,LONDON,0,وجهة نظري عملة الفيسبوك هيا اكبر امتحان لي البتكوين و ممكن تكون المنافس ليها لكن الفرق اللي مستحيل يمكن لي الفيسبوك عمله هو ان تكون العملة لامركزية و هذا ما يميز البتكوين بحيث الفيسبوك ممكن يتعرض لي ضغط من حكومات بي إيقاف استعمالها او احتكارها لكن بتكوين لا يمكن ايقافها قانونياً
1138441227580387328,1560260514000,LONDON,0,و الشيء الثاني المتخوف منه هو ان الفيسبوك حاليا فاقد للثقة و في بعض المتخوفين من سوء استعمال الفيسبوك لي بيانات الشخصية و استغلالها في السياسة و توجيه الناس لي فكر معين و انتشار الإرهاب و العنصرية وغيرها من المشاكل التي يعتبر الفيسبوك مسؤل عليها وله علم بيها لكنه قليلا ما يوقفها
