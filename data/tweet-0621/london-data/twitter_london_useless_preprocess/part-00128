1140335432942702593,1560712128000,LONDON,-1,1/ Today on the bus a man was loudly complaining about a woman of colour speaking on her phone. He was talking about getting his country back, how he shouldn’t have to hear her “gibberish”. I told him to stop being rude and be quiet
1140335436595892224,1560712129000,LONDON,-1,2/ He replies that he doesn’t want to hear my nonsense and that he’s just ‘minding his own business’. I tell him that if he was just minding his business he doesn’t need to shout it on a full bus
1140335439729106945,1560712129000,LONDON,1,@MJCarty @SJStephen1 Thank you!

1140335448742662144,1560712132000,LONDON,-1,4/ He turns away and starts talking to another man on the bus, talking about how I am ruining the country that he’s ‘fighting to protect’. His stop comes and he turns around, tells me once again that I am responsible for ruining this country
