1138575941591023617,1560292632000,NULL,0,Apparently today is #empathyday... Since ‘reading for empathy’ has become a bit of a bumper sticker for our field, I just wanted to say a few words of caution: 1) Be careful not to conflate theory of mind and empathy, because it’s ableist and, more importantly, it’s nonsense.

1138575946284486657,1560292633000,NULL,-1,2) Empathy is not inherently ‘good’. Not saying that it can’t motivate positive social change or prompt positive personal / interpersonal experiences BUT empathy for empathy’s sake is ambivalent at best, indulgent - even paralysing - at worst. It’s not the key to a moral compass.
1138575948389998592,1560292634000,NULL,-1,3) It doesn’t matter how fuzzy the idea of empathy makes you feel, if you are justifying the place of literature in classrooms on grounds that it delivers measurable learning outcomes, you are part of the Neo-Liberal movement to instrumentalise the arts. Don’t play their game.
1138575950638178304,1560292635000,NULL,-1,4) It’s tempting to apply cognitive neuroscience to literacy / literary research - especially when it confirms biases we already hold (like books are valuable). But I’m dating a neuroscientist and I can tell you studies that seem wonderfully conclusive to us, look flimsy to him.
