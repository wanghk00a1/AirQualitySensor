1135931142597742593,1559662063000,NULL,-1,the Lib Dems were all but wiped out at Westminster in 2015. Scottish Labour have been a non-event for years. But these parties at least still have the infrastructure to do things. They have a membership who can go out and campaign; they have staff; they hold local council seats.
1135931145206587399,1559662064000,NULL,-1,the structure of Change UK’s party is upside-down. In all other political parties — big or small — elected representatives occupy the smallest strata at the top at the top of a pyramid. ChUK are all MPs and nothing else. Who goes door-knocking for ChUK? It is a doomed enterprise.
1135931148037758979,1559662064000,NULL,-1,practically speaking, the most logical move now is to merge with the Lib Dems — the biggest centrist/Remain party in the UK who are experiencing something of a rebirth right now — but I feel like factional issues will make this harder than it might appear.
