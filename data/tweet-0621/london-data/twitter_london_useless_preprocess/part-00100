1139447856169926656,1560500513000,LONDON,-1,Je vais vous raconter des choses qui sont arrivées. Elle me porter l’œil salement. Bref à l’époque j’avais pas le permis et je roulais en voiture en GLA en plus (C’est pas un exemple ne faite pas comme moi, c’est vraiment pas bien) et donc ce jour la jdis au revoir à tt le monde
1139447857860268032,1560500513000,LONDON,-1,Sauf à elle, parce que ce jour la elle m’avait soulé donc je lâche un au revoir sec, elle m’a dit ah ouais? J’espère tu te fait contrôler! J’étais à porte de Pantin y’a des policiers ils me suivent en civil dans les bouchons jusqu’à Stade de France il me font sortir
1139447859479220224,1560500514000,LONDON,-1,Contrôle d’identité + papier de la voiture. Pas de permis hop on m’embarque. Immobilisation du véhicule. Donc GAV, pas d’OPJ je suis obligé d’attendre le matin pour pouvoir sortir. Ce jour la je l’ai insulté dès que je suis sortis. (Oui désolé j’ai le sang qui bouillonne vite)
1139447861278650368,1560500514000,LONDON,-1,Une autre fois en février dernier je partais en Algérie pour quelques jours. En tant que potes bah je préviens c’est normal je leur annonce que je pars. Bref même histoire je lui dit salut et elle me de dit j’espère ton avion il a galère. Je me suis dit oulala je vais peut-être
1139447862960500736,1560500515000,LONDON,-1,mourir aujourd’hui.. Soubhan’Allah depuis petit j’ai pris un nombre incalculable d’avion mais jamais il m’était arrivé ça. J’ai embarqué et débarqué de deux avions différents pour cause de problème technique!!! Genre on a du changer deux fois d’avion! On a eu 5h de retard!
1139447864537624576,1560500515000,LONDON,-1,Donc je les appelle en conférences, ils sont choqués ils m’ont dit “Mais c’est incroyable!!! Aïcha elle vraiment un œil puissant” (Oui, elle s’appelle Aïcha). Donc elle me dit me cherche pas sinon tu verras il va t’arriver pire au retour. Je lui de fermer sa gueule et rebelotte.
1139447866064285696,1560500515000,LONDON,-1,La veille de mon départ pour rentrer je reçois un e-mail pour me dire que mon vol est annulé. Alors la j’étais vraiment abasourdi. J’étais vraiment choqué parce que c’était plus une coïncidence mdrrr donc je leur dit que je vais prolonger de 2-3jours ici mais j’avais un billet
1139447867691675648,1560500516000,LONDON,-1,retour pour le jour même de l’annulation parce que ils nous avaient mis dans les vols vident. Mais je leur avaient rien dit. Incroyable!

1139447870950641664,1560500517000,LONDON,-1,Donc instinctivement, moi je dis oui. Ceux qui me connaissent savent que je refuse jamais rien. Et donc c’était sensé être rapide vu que c’était que tu periph de Porte de Pantin à Porte d’italie pour ceux qui connaissent bien le periph c’est une histoire de 15-20 minutes.
1139447873098137605,1560500517000,LONDON,-1,Je vais pour prendre le periph, déjà il est fermé pour travaux. Je me dis ah ouais ça commence bien.. donc xeux qui connaissent savent que quand c’est fermé les longues lignes droite avec des feux tout les 200m qui séparent Pantin et Bagnolet.
1139447874851409920,1560500517000,LONDON,-1,Donc tranquille j’allais pas me désister je prends par la ville. J’accepte de me faire manquer de respect par les feux toute les 2 minutes. C’est pas je roule tranquille, sans aucune infraction. Je me fait arrêter. Donc cette fois je suis content un peu.

1139447869356859392,1560500516000,LONDON,-1,Franchement un autre jour marquant avec elle. Donc j’étais enfin permifier, j’avais acheté une nouvelle voiture tout en règle assurance, carte grise, permis, la totale quoi. C’est le soir donc les routes sont vides et elle me demande si je peux la déposer chez elle?
1139447876461957120,1560500518000,LONDON,-1,J’étais entièrement en règle, j’ai fait 0 infraction. Je fais le malin parce que pour moi il peux rien faire. wAllah j’étais archi pas prêt. Ils regardent le véhicule, le coffre tout. Il reviens me voir. Il me dit on va vous mettre une amende pour “phare saillant”. ??????
1139447878248796165,1560500518000,LONDON,-1,J’ai dit “Quoi ????!” J’ai reçu l’amende chez moi je l’ai jamais payé, elle doit traîner quelques part encore.Donc je reprends la route. Je rigole archi pas, je parle plus. Et la t’avais cette bouffone à côté qui rigolé et qui me disais “Ah ouais je t’ai encore porté la poisse”
1139447879943294976,1560500519000,LONDON,-1,J’avais qu’une envie c’était de la laisser sur la bande d’arrêt d’urgence la plus proche.Bon y’a encore beaucoup trop d’histoire mais bon je pense que c’est suffisant pour que vous sachiez que l’oeil existe mdrr c’était vraiment un chat noir cette fille.
1139447881683877888,1560500519000,LONDON,-1,Bon une dernière histoire. Celle la concerne un de mes meilleurs amis (Aïcha n’a plus rien a voir ici).Mon pote était étudiant à l’époque, il avait déjà son bac +5 en tant qu’ingénieur aéronautique, et il voulais devenir pilote. Il avait donc intégré l’ENAC.
1139447883604905984,1560500520000,LONDON,-1,Pour ceux qui connaissent cette école vous connaissez forcément sa réputation. Sinon je vous invite à aller voir leur site pour ceux que ça intéresse. Et donc, il arrive à un moment excitant pour lui. Sa première heure de vol. Elle se passe merveilleusement bien
1139447885274259456,1560500520000,LONDON,-1,Je l’avais jamais entendu aussi content. Donc bon lui il appelle sa maman (elle vit en Tunisie) donc il lui raconte sa journée et sa première heure de vol. À côté de sa maman y’avais sa voisine et elle sort “Ah ouais ton fils déjà il vol?” en arabe, j’ai traduit directement.
1139447886951985153,1560500520000,LONDON,-1,Mais bon je vous laisse imaginer le ton de la dame. Le lendemain mon pote fait un accident de moto. Fauteuil roulant pendant 6 mois. Il était dans l’incapacité de marcher. Aujourd’hui hamdoulilah il fait tout normalement, comme si il y’avais jamais eu d’accident

1139447891318235136,1560500521000,LONDON,-1,Donc voilà un dernier conseil : faite vos projets en silence. Évitez d’en parler autour de vous. Parce que même si une personne ne vous veux pas forcément de mal, elle peut vous porter l’œil inconsciemment.
