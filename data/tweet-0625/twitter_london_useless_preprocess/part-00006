1142774343774216198,1561293609000,LONDON,-1,#trans equality discussions have been absolutely derailed. A vulnerable & marginalised group has become further marginalised. It is the most disappointing aspect of the so called ‘debate’ on gender recognition. It has clouded any attempts to improve the lives of #trans people.
1142774347339325440,1561293610000,LONDON,-1,A vulnerable community can no longer discuss their needs or raise issues with law, policy & practice that discriminate against them. Instead, these conversations about reaching equality for #trans people are immediately hijacked and it becomes about free speech & everyone else.
1142774350392766464,1561293611000,LONDON,-1,As a result of this #transphobic climate, crucial discussions about #trans people’s healthcare needs, social marginalisation, discriminatory treatment, exclusion from employment, etc. Can’t be tackled in any meaningful sense.
1142774352808689665,1561293612000,LONDON,-1,We’re at a point where any & all issues affecting #trans people are being drowned out by transphobic campaigners. & the result is prolonged inequality and exacerbated prejudice against #trans communities. This is a coordinated hate campaign to remove trans people from society.

1142863196627378178,1561314794000,LONDON,-1,If your a business with bees on your premises, you ought to have a policy and contingency plan in place for when your hives swarm. Your paid beekeeper should be on call to deal with such instances and not simply rely on over worked voluntary swarm collectors from @britishbee.
1142863199634690048,1561314794000,LONDON,-1,I’ve had a horrid weekend here in London with swarms in high profile city centre locations which could only have come from hives on commercial premises. I know their are hives on roofs right above the streets where I’ve been called to. It’s unacceptable and irresponsible!
1142863202079952896,1561314795000,LONDON,-1,It’s socially irresponsible to first off allow your bees to swarm in the city centre and then to have no plans to collect them relying on volunteers who have to incur congestion and Ulez road charges in the process. Swarms in the city impact neighbours and other businesses.
