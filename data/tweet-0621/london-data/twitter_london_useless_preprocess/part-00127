1140333852579237890,1560711751000,LONDON,-1,My take on #C4debate - Stewart best by miles. Hunt and Javid were awful. Gove started poorly but got much better - mostly because he was holding back on Brexit plans. Raab was clear on Brexit - a Daenerys Targaryen version - but he has nothing to say on anything else.
1140333853057396736,1560711751000,LONDON,-1,Stewart and Javid came across on C4 as proper human beings. Raab dangerous. Hunt, and especially Gove, unconvincing
