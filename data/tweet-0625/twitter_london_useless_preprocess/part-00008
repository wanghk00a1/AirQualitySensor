1143062150002462721,1561362228000,LONDON,0,Hey Dev twitter. Do you attend meet-ups or conferences?If so, listen up.I’m going to tell you a couple of stories...
1143062153571766272,1561362229000,LONDON,-1,First story: It was the first time I had spoken at a meet-up. I. Was. Terrified.I hadn’t learnt the “run demo’s locally” lesson yet, my WiFi cut out and in the panic, the mic I’d placed on the table next to me rolled off and made the loudest noise known to man.
1143062155190833152,1561362229000,LONDON,-1,The entire time this was happening, the audience sat, expressionless, apart from one chap at the back of the room. Every time I looked his way he smiled, nodded and threw me a constant stream of thumbs ups.
1143062156965007360,1561362229000,LONDON,0,I have quite bad anxiety, and his lovely friendly face got me through the talk. I got my slides sorted. Picked up the mic. And whenever I felt nervous I just looked his way and felt instantly better.
1143062158789566464,1561362230000,LONDON,1,Second story: I was halfway through another talk, it was going really well and I was very excited about the topic.A man in my line of vision started shuffling about in his chair.He rolled his eyes, crossed his arms, shut his eyes and settled back in his chair for a nap.
1143062160668540928,1561362230000,LONDON,-1,The excitement I was feeling was instantly replaced with a barrage of negative thoughts.I tried to focus on other people but kept being drawn back to him.I feel like the rest of my talk flew past in a panic. I wasn’t as engaged, the talk wasn’t as good as it could have been.
1143062163646550016,1561362231000,LONDON,-1,If someone had rolled their eyes and had a nap during my first talk, I doubt I would have given it another shot.If you attend a meet-up or conference. Be the first person in this story.Smile, nod, be supportive. Your body language may make more difference than you know.

1143105700224282625,1561372611000,LONDON,-1,I've *very strongly considered* using react-native-web for this project. However, I'm not going to for the following reasons 👇🏽 I'd very much like to be wrong on this so let me know if I am! 🙏🏽

1143105701419638784,1561372611000,LONDON,-1,1. My main goal is to unify a web codebase with a React Native codebase. Otherwise I'm coding in an abstraction which, as nice as it can be, is still an abstraction at the end of the day.I want to make this point clear upfront as it is my main consideration.
1143105702522687489,1561372612000,LONDON,-1,2. When coding React Native, I use react-navigation, gesture handler, etc etc. While I could use react-navigation on the web, arguably react-router (and the merge with reach/router) are better suited. There's a11y considerations that I'm unsure how react-navigation handles on web
1143105703550377984,1561372612000,LONDON,-1,@JobFlintshire Did he creep you out, like he did me?
1143105703806144512,1561372612000,LONDON,-1,Sure, I could use react-router on native. However, I give away all the mobile-specific goodness baked into react-navigation. I don't have Stacks or Drawers or Tab views, etc etc on react-router-native. It's also URL based which has pros & cons on native.
1143105704099766272,1561372612000,LONDON,-1,On a Southern train to London and everyone is talking about the behaviour of Cameroun’s players yesterday. I feel a bit ashamed but quickly consoled myself with our determination to see an Independent Southern Cameroons #Ambazonia. We’re different from them. Yes, but unity is key
1143105704858984448,1561372612000,LONDON,-1,3. The web is all about application delivery. You need to load just enough content to deliver the experience. Thus code splitting is popular.On mobile, you bundle everything into the app. Metro bundler doesn't even support import() syntax.

1143105706209566721,1561372612000,LONDON,-1,I could transpile dynamic imports away but that also changes the nature of my app. It's kind of weird to transpile away the expectation of asynchronicity... Could be fine? But weird nonetheless 🤷🏽‍♂️
1143105707476160512,1561372613000,LONDON,0,"But Taz, didn't you give that talk on supporting multiple platforms via react-native-web??" https://t.co/vHONmi5qA2Ya! Give it a watch!Difference between that and what I'm doing now is that that was mobile-first transported onto Electron. They're all bundled apps.
1143105708667412481,1561372613000,LONDON,0,That app is proof that you _can_ make this work. But is it worth it?Best use cases that I've seen of react-native-web are to bring the same component model to the web and not strictly for web-and-native shared codebases. E.g. Twitter.Are there good examples to the contrary?

1143110800393080832,1561373827000,LONDON,0,Summertime is right around the corner and the best time to start your job search 🌞Everyone always assumes that companies put hiring on hold during the holidays but that is not the case, in fact, this alone gives you the upper hand. Here are three basic reasons as
1143110801336754176,1561373827000,LONDON,0,to why now is a great time 💁Your competition will be in holiday modeWhen you job-hunt in the summer, you stay available for opportunities that others have decided to pass over for no good reason. You will stand out from that small pile of CV's that
1143110802414735361,1561373827000,LONDON,-1,the hiring manager has to review across July and August (Applying from September onwards your competition doubles and it will lessen your chances for securing that dream job)
1143110803421302784,1561373828000,LONDON,-1,Taking time off to interviewTaking days off to interview is always tricky. It shouldn't be hard during the summer months as managers expect their employees to take time off and wouldn't suspect that you have booked a day or two off to interview
1143110804436393985,1561373828000,LONDON,-1,Fewer emails = more opportunityCV feedback can usually take around 3 days, however, in the summer people get fewer emails. You're more than likely to get a response quicker during the summer than Autumn as everyone is back to work trying to catch up from their summer holiday
