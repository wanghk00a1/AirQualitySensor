1139932333153357825,1560616021000,LONDON,-1,...that cutting tax is all about smaller - much smaller - government, both in the UK, in the EU and less of the Paris-type accords on Climate Change... because they all require functioning government. But to achieve the tax-cutting nirvana...
1139932335963615232,1560616022000,LONDON,-1,...first Johnson must don his shield of truth and brexit breastplate whilst picking up his trusty sword and slaying the Corbyn dragon. For nothing strikes fear into the private club more than tax...
