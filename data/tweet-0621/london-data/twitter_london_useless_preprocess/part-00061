1137835082876694529,1560115998000,LONDON,-1,Typing some of this is going to feel so awkward, but here goes nothing...(tw: suicide)
1137835087196839936,1560115999000,LONDON,-1,I have to confess that my gender dysphoria dates back to over a decade. Being a severely autistic kid prone to fearing consequence, I refused haircuts for several years which, combined with an adorable face, got me confused for a girl by some during my time at secondary school.
1137835089163882496,1560115999000,LONDON,-1,From an overdose of Bugs Bunny and to a lesser extent James from Pokémon, I‘d find myself fascinated in crossdressing, to the point of wondering what it would be like to have breasts, stuffing toys up my shirt to make it look so. Wasn’t proud of this but my long hair sure helped.
1137835091646918656,1560116000000,LONDON,-1,I felt indifferent towards my gender since then, but have struggled to maintain a clear identity. I think it shows from the nine years that I’ve been on Twitter that I’ve been desperate to blend in with this community, but in reality, socialising for me is difficult/dangerous.
1137835095673516033,1560116001000,LONDON,-1,I’ve tried social clubs for the disabled to no avail - even without men above 50, I’ve failed to click with anyone, and when I have, I’ve eventually faded away from them. I don’t usually feel lonely because I feel it’s safer for me to be independent and yet, sometimes I do...

1137835097326018566,1560116001000,LONDON,-1,Come to think of it, I have sometimes wondered what it would be like to have a female body, particularly during my weight gain fantasies. It started with pillows, and while I usually imagine myself with a huge, soft belly as I am now, I also imagine aaand I’ve lost you, haven’t I
1137835102124290048,1560116002000,LONDON,-1,With the toxicity of (white) men becoming increasingly visible, my shame of being one grows with every cancellation. It doesn’t help that the patriarchy in power doesn’t want me to exist. I don’t want them to define me, or to grow up to be one of the bland old guys around me.
1137835104611504136,1560116003000,LONDON,-1,I feel ashamed of this body. I suffer from trichotillomania, but I also constantly shave. I hate my face, my voice, my hairs and my dick so fucking much. Sometimes I feel impulsed to kill myself because of how worthless I make life for myself. I want to look at myself and smile.

1137835106708729857,1560116004000,LONDON,-1,Many female-driven stories in recent years, especially Booksmart, fill me with envy as they present lives more free, more exuberant than mine or anyone like me. Why aren’t there movies about trans women that make me feel this way? Why do they all have to be driven by cis dudes?!

1137835108998799361,1560116004000,LONDON,-1,Getting the support, meds and if need be surgery to become a real woman, especially a lesbian, would be the answer to my self-loathing, my identity crises, my camera shyness and my phobias, I hope. Life could be more exciting and special for me so long as I don’t go out at night.
1137835111276265472,1560116005000,LONDON,-1,(One of those consequential fears involves clubbing and walking out late for funsies, I of course am not one to risk recklessness. With a partner to supervise me, I’m sure I’ll feel just a little bit safer, except I’m well aware of what happened in Camden this week...)
1137835114187108352,1560116005000,LONDON,-1,But how do I tell them, now that I’ve told you? Recently, I’ve had to replace my debit card and my passport photo, and I’m still trying to seek a job. Apart from at the Prince Charles Cinema, transgendered people are scarce in my surroundings, which leaves me feeling uncertain.
1137835116955414528,1560116006000,LONDON,-1,I know it’s Pride Month, but how do I come out as trans to my family when my life is already complicated as it is? How do I endure a life that I feel is ideal for me, but a threat to others? How do I take the risk, when I’m too afraid to take risks?
