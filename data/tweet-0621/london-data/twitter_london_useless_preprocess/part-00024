1135172367213322241,1559481157000,LONDON,0,The US healthcare system’s issues are with waste on inappropriate treatments from bad incentives, huge agency costs because of the lack of centralised bargaining, huge staff costs due to doctors’ unions, and huge and wasteful pharma costs because they have no NICE equivalent
1135172369910247424,1559481158000,LONDON,-1,These are issues which all arise from a) the corporatist foundations of US healthcare and the individualist freedom this gives “healthcare consumers” and b) the resulting lack of any monopsony power similar to that the NHS has to ration, reduce drug costs and constrain unions
