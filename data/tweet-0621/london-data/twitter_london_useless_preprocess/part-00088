1138760604217487360,1560336659000,LONDON,1,All this has actually happened to me.
1138760611490410502,1560336661000,LONDON,-1,A story of personal harassment:Last night a colleague decides to take the same route as me home.He didn't ask if it was okay.He invited himself.I chose to walk along the busy main roads, he took me through the empty side walks to show a 'quicker way'.
1138760613092573184,1560336661000,LONDON,-1,He proceeded to begin dirty talk'- dishing the dirt on his previous relationships and experiences, asking me to do the same.I was revolted. I told him to part ways and take another train .He ignore me and stayed.
1138760614736797696,1560336662000,LONDON,-1,Things only get worse. He continues with the vulgar talk.compliments my figure, touches my leg. To which I shout at him and tell him to get lost. He doesn't go anywhere, responds instead : 'You look tense'?!#?£?#&
1138760616548716544,1560336662000,LONDON,-1,I keep moving seats on the train but he follows to sit beside me. I gesture to another male nearby that I'm being harassed but he blanks me.So I sat with my headphones in pretending to listen to everything he says.
1138760618062876675,1560336663000,LONDON,-1,I run when it gets to my stop. He still follows me ! Asking for a hug ?!Thankfully a train attendant was stood at my stop and I told him to stay with me. He realised straight away the situation and stuck with me till I left the station .
1138760622496239616,1560336664000,LONDON,-1,In conclusion:I was mortified, shocked at the audacity of a male who continued to pester me despite my lack of interest and discontent. Don't you understand the meaning of a simple no'? Also, isn't this the beginnings of rape culture ?
1138760622911434754,1560336664000,LONDON,0,Burnley. Away.
