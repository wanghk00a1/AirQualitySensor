1138914494736941057,1560373350000,LONDON,-1,LOOOOOL OMG TOMMY REALLY SAID THAT TO MOLLY #LoveIsland
1138914494418247685,1560373350000,LONDON,-1,[1/9]It’s annoying when you have a flaw - one both you & friends resignedly know - confirmed, even if it’s for the most trivial of things. And this IS trivial, definitely.I’m a creature of habit, sometimes to my detriment. I say that to confirm the triviality of my annoyance.
1138914496309792775,1560373350000,LONDON,-1,FINALLY THIS IS WHAT THE STREETS WANTED 💉💉 #LoveIsland
1138914498335707138,1560373351000,LONDON,-1,[2/9]As long-term followers know, I quit smoking back end of 2016. I’ve been vaping since then, and for the past year or so, it’s been with an Aspire PockeX.I like the kit, a lot. Not much vapour & I like the taste of the liquids. Again, habit: usually a light lemon flavour.
1138914500172812290,1560373351000,LONDON,-1,[3/9]About a month ago, I started noticing the liquid was dark, dirty, at the bottom of the tank before refill. I mean, really dirty. Didn’t affect taste but it irked.Took me ages to discover why: I’d been using the ‘wrong’ liquid for a year, the ‘wrong’ VG/PG balance.
1138914500898435072,1560373351000,LONDON,0,@imLucyWatson Of course! You and Amber are two very straightforward honest women who people react to like Marmite! 🤣 #KindredSpirits
1138914502177636352,1560373351000,LONDON,-1,[4/9]The liquid I’d been using was, apparently, too ‘thin’ for the kit/atomiser combination I had. The nicotine in the lemon-flavoured liquid - a very pale yellow liquid, as it happens - was being heated too high, by the kit.So I was advised to change the liquid.So I did.
1138914504232882179,1560373352000,LONDON,0,[5/9]Sticking with the same brand (well, same manufacturer) I changed to a 50/50 mix, but similar light citrus flavour.I was warned up front that I’d have to get used to it; it’d take time, after a year of the other liquid.So… anyway, I bought three bottles & tried it.
1138914505998655492,1560373352000,LONDON,-1,[6/9]I. Hate. It.The closest flavours taste horrible compared to the old liquid. And I don’t like the feel of it in my mouth, the hit to my throat, anything.Hate it, hate it, hate it.And I *know* that a huge part of it is because I don’t like change, I don’t like ‘new’.
1138914507869302784,1560373353000,LONDON,-1,[7/9]So, as I use my last bottle of the ‘new’ liquid, I’m almost torn between toughing it out……or saying ‘fuck it’ & going back to the ‘wrong’ liquid - accepting the genuine annoyance of the dirty bit, and wiping it out - at the end of the tank.And leaning to the latter.
1138914509739954176,1560373353000,LONDON,-1,[8/9]There’s also an element of “Hell, I’M paying for the liquids, so I get to have the liquids I LIKE rather than what someone else tells me I should have”. But also, there’s a huge part of: ‘you’re a stubborn bastard & you’ve just decided you like things the way they were.’
1138914511577112576,1560373354000,LONDON,-1,[9/9]Anyway, I told you it was. trivial, and that it confirms a self-defeating flaw - mild or otherwise - in my character. And when close friends read this, esp the ones who started me on this ‘quiting cigs, use a vape’ journey, they’ll good-naturedly sigh... and nod./fin
