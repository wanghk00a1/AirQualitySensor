1134525340343312384,1559326894000,LONDON,-1,dysphoria isn't the opposite from euphoria. it's related to an emotion that allistics cannot perceive which i call 'impel'.
1134525342302035968,1559326894000,LONDON,-1,Impel (as the name suggests) is your inner drive which gets you up in the morning (or not if you have depression). i think it's related to serotonin.
1134525345057705984,1559326895000,LONDON,-1,Impel valence is either outwards or inwards. So euphoria (and mania) is usually associated with outward valence impel whilst dysphoria (and depression) with inward valence impel.
1134525346089447424,1559326895000,LONDON,0,@thisnoiserocks 🙌🏻🖤🙏🏼
1134525346773164032,1559326895000,LONDON,-1,But too much impel either way is profoundly unpleasant and is separate from mood. Too much outward valence impel is akathesia, restlessness without any direction. It's profoundly unpleasant. Essentially it's stir crazy or cabin fever magnified.

1134525350870945794,1559326896000,LONDON,0,Inward valence impel is also unpleasant, There isn't a word for it in English like 'stir crazy' or 'cabin fever' but it's the feeling you get when you've been out all day and get home and are about to sit down but then realise you've forgotten to post your IMPORTANT letter.
1134525353903513600,1559326897000,LONDON,-1,So have to go out again. It's fairly unpleasant. That's what depression is like for me. Having to force yourself to do things that you'd really not be bothered with.
