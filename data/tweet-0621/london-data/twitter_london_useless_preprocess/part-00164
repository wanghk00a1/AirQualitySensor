1141451845321285633,1560978301000,LONDON,0,@Archipelington Yep. And did you see any of the England game? The ball hit the ref and the new rule says that the attacking side gets the ball back. That essentially gives the attacking side an extra 'player'. If the attacking side get in a tight spot they can just hit it against the ref.
