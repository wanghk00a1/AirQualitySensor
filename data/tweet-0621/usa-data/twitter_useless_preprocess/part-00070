Lightly toast the rice. Add water. Bring to boil. Cover and reduce to low heat. Cook 12-15 min. Rest. The result will be a fluffy rice.

1139392832664244229,1560487394000,CHICAGO,-1,And I don't disagree that first and foremost pro-choice men need to uplift women who have been leading the fight for decades first, second, and last, but we can't turn our backs, persuasion efforts, and advocacy mobilization to men who want to help.
