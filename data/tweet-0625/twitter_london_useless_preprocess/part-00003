1142366785368408064,1561196440000,LONDON,-1,@MissJoT @Lodgelees @MissLLewis Exactly. I would argue that social mobility, wealth or affluence really should not be anywhere near our visions for education.
1142366786614124544,1561196440000,LONDON,-1,Firstly, this seems to underline why collaborative enquiry (eg Lesson Study) may be such an effective model for teachers, but also helps us understand the plausible boundary conditions.
1142366790015684608,1561196441000,LONDON,0,It's effective because problem-solving in the domain of classroom pedagogy is so complex that a combined, larger collective working memory could be very beneficial.
1142366791823495169,1561196441000,LONDON,-1,But having all novice teachers working together on enquiry can lead to unguided search for solutions. The presence of an expert can structure and guide the group, reducing conflict, unproductive work and extraneous cognitive load.
1142366793622859776,1561196442000,LONDON,-1,This Collaborative Cognitive Load Theory also suggests why there may be a significant difference in effectiveness between the first few times engaging in enquiry and the effectiveness of a more experienced group. This strongly resonates with my experience around Lesson Study.

1142379251913674753,1561199412000,LONDON,-1,Boris Johnson will be a terrible Prime Minister. When the London riots happened, his response wasn't to try and heal or improve the relationship between Black Londoners and the MPS, but to buy water cannon.
1142379253058723841,1561199412000,LONDON,-1,His response was to arm the city against uprising, rather than address the cause of uprising. His premiership will be an absolute calamity and betrayal of the country's most vulnerable communities, and if we dare to stand up to him, he'll probably issue shoot to kill orders.

If you have a baby, have sex within the first weeks and consistently have sex your vagina will shape and adapt to that size.
