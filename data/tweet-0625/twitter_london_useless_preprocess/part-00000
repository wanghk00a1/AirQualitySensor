His coffin draped in the flag of the Third Reich was taken from the embassy in Carlton House Terrace to Victoria Station. https://t.co/UntaqYNj7h
1141995208890101760,1561107849000,LONDON,0,There is more to this story than meets the eye though. Von Hoesch was appointed as ambassador in 1932, by the previous regime and was therefore not a Nazi appointee. He was widely liked in London, being essentially a man of peace who was not sympathetic to the Nazis. https://t.co/DjKkrRioDc
1141995210903379969,1561107850000,LONDON,-1,He was nearing the end of his tenure as ambassador when he died suddenly from a heart attack. As nobody could be seen to be "off-message" with the Nazis, he was given the full ceremonial send off, including the odd sight of one of HM Destroyers flying the German ensign.

1141995212128096256,1561107850000,LONDON,-1,Despite all the ceremonial in London and aboard HMS Scout, when the destroyer carrying his remains arrived in Wilhelmshaven and his coffin was offloaded for transit to his home city of Dresden, he was then basically airbrushed from history by the Nazi Party.
1141995213289873408,1561107850000,LONDON,-1,He was given a private family funeral in Dresden and had no official representatives present from the Nazi regime. His replacement as ambassador to the Court of St James, was Ribbentrop, later to be hanged as a war criminal at Nuremburg. END
