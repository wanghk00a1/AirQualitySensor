1142132564590768128,1561140597000,LONDON,-1,@FIFAWWC I strongly think it is unfair for other teams trying to qualify for the Round of 16 to know how many goals they need to score or how many cards they need to avoid in order to qualify. That is not fair play. Devise a way to play last group games at the same time.
