1138382917686702080,1560246612000,LONDON,-1,Let’s remember Hodge in 1983 was lined up by the right of party to be the MP for Islington North and as leader of the council was considered a shoe in. @JeremyCorbyn4PM stood as a rank a file member and won. She has never forgiven him and has dedicated her time to undermine him.
1138382920324976640,1560246612000,LONDON,-1,Hodge has routinely called anyone who works with @UKLabour leader @jeremycorbyn including @Keir_Starmer “collaborators” and as the enemy.

1138398433243475968,1560250311000,LONDON,-1,1/ Feel like your #startup is drowning in noise and you can't break through?Solution: be different!
1138398434367614982,1560250311000,LONDON,-1,2/ Startups are often made in the same factory (okay, incubator, accelerator, student dorm) and they acquire a set of unwritten rules which can make them all feel 'kinda the same'.
1138398435684618240,1560250312000,LONDON,-1,3/ An early goal for every #startup is to stand out - and that requires it to be different.Previously, 'standing out' had just been about being 'digital' or using current web design practice in a world of legacy businesses. Now...

1138398438494810113,1560250312000,LONDON,-1,5/ "Ego is out...dissidence [or activism] is in"@pmarcaSo the path to number one therefore has to change — from selling the 'digital' disruption to a new kind of business led activism.
1138398440038240261,1560250313000,LONDON,-1,6/ And the challenge is not just becoming the top company, but *staying* at number one as your business expands from a few partners, to a few followers to offices across continentsSo how do you do that?
1138398441254637570,1560250313000,LONDON,1,7/ It's still the mission!Question: is your mission (your organisation's purpose) powerful enough to sustain its growth to a team of 10 and then 100 and then 1,000?
