1141629693487173635,1561020704000,LONDON,-1,The idea, which I’ve heard asserted by left-liberal friends, that the free market is a coercive force of heteronormativity (co-dependent, monogamous relationships), and that only these relationship structures allow the transfer of property between generations to be SO homophobic.
1141629698188992512,1561020705000,LONDON,-1,The free market, like any structure, has rules to follow. But the difference with the state is, the market is not a one dimensional entity.It’s been a force for empowering Queer lifestyles and making it possible to emancipate ourselves from heteronormativity.
