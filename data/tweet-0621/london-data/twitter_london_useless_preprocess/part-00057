1137758083457921024,1560097640000,LONDON,0,@amjonno I disagree with you there!!! Liverpool scored an offside goal which was allowed to stand and meant they won a game and got 2 extra points therefore keeping them in the title race!! If they‚Äôd won by1point then you‚Äôd have heard it‚Äôs not right!! VAR will now eliminate that!!
