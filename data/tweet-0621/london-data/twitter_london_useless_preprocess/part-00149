1141048463725146114,1560882128000,LONDON,-1,Brief thoughts on tonight’s #BBCDebate:1. Questions coming in from TV studios; no [live] audience in the room. Can’t help thinking that’s going to hurt Boris Johnson. The “geeing up the audience” & “appeal to ‘Britain can be great again’” shtick ain’t gonna play.
1141048468976353280,1560882129000,LONDON,-1,2. Flip side of that: it’s harder for Rory Stewart to *obviously* impress. There’s no immediacy to the response. So harder for *him* to judge how he’s doing. And if he comes over as petulant (as he did at times on Sunday), easy to not realise#BBCDebate
1141048472503803905,1560882130000,LONDON,-1,3. That applies to them all: they’ll have no idea how *well* they’re doing during it, but they’ll know from the other candidates’ reactions if they’ve just fucked up an answer.4.
