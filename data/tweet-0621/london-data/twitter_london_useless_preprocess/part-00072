Он напуган, очень.Увидел человека, который был уверен в себе, но почти сломался.#ИванГолунов #Golunov @meduzaproject https://t.co/dlziuOKYRk
1138202348847865856,1560203561000,LONDON,-1,Видимо в тот день было больше,чем нам всем рассказали.Думаю,парню показали его же похороны.  Реально,с выкопанной могилой,холостым выстрелом. И строго настрого запретили идти дальше определённой границы. Есть такая методика#ИванГолунов #Golunov @meduzaproject #свободуголунову https://t.co/pNq33tu4Hi
1138202352907902976,1560203562000,LONDON,-1,Поэтому, когда он понял, что вокруг пошла движуха -  он заплакал. Но дальше определённой границы не пошёл. И НЕ ПОЙДЁТ, ни при каких условиях. И, видимо ему очертили даже сектор, который он должен покрыть. И он это делает.#ИванГолунов #Golunov @meduzaproject #свободуголунову https://t.co/aKF5aFg5Gw
