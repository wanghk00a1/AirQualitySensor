To be able to grow with you and the band and your music is something I will hold close to me. Not videoing Waves made me realise how important memories are and how important you-
1135369819321184256,1559528233000,LONDON,-1,-Have been over the 4-5 years of me following the band. If you hadn’t of joined the vamps I may have never liked the band, met you (and made a fool of myself) at a book signing in the Olympic stadium and seen you four times. Without you making a life changing  decision-
1135369820919218176,1559528234000,LONDON,-1,- I may never have had some of the best times in my life. Because of you, I have made friends. Because of you I found new music taste, like fall out boy, p!atd and all time low. Without you I wouldn’t be who I am today. So thank you Con-
